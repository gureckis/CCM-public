    "until the end of an episode. You do this many times and then average together\n",
    "the rewards received to estimate the value of the state or action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, as you did in problem 1, you adjust your policy to become greedy with\n",

    "use this variable in our solution. Thus, average the returns following the\n",
    "first visit to a particular action.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is what policy we should use for running our Monte Carlo updates.\n",
    "If we randomly initialize the policy as we did above and then run it forward\n",
    "it is very easy for the runs to get caught in cycles and loops that never\n",
