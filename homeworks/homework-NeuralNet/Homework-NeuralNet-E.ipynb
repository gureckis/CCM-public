    "  embedding vector (size `hidden_size=20`) to represent each input word. These\n",
    "  vectors are learnable parameters. When a word is provided as input to the\n",
    "  SRN, it is converted to the corresponding input embedding. This layer is\n",
    "  setup for you already in the started class,\n",
    "  `self.embed = nn.Embedding(vocab_size,hidden_size)`\n",
    "- **Hidden layer**. This layer has length `hidden_size` and uses the\n",
    "  **logistic** activation function. The initial vector $h_{-1}$ should be all\n",
    "  zeros.\n",
    "- **Output layer**. This layer has length `vocab_size` and uses the\n",
    "  **softmax** activation function. Thus, the SRN will represent an explicit\n",
    "  probability distribution over the next token $w_j$ given the past tokens\n",
    "  $w_1,\\dots,w_{j-1}$, through the equation $P(w_j | w_1,\\dots,w_{j-1})$\n",
    "- **Loss**. The SRN will train to maximize the log-likelihood of the target\n",
    "  output words, e.g., we use the negative log-likelihood loss `nn.NLLLoss`. If\n",
    "  passed a tensor representing multiple target predictions, this loss takes\n",
    "  the mean across predictions.\n",
    "- **Optimizer**. We found reasonable results with the `AdamW` optimizer with\n",
    "  weight decay of 0.04. Adam is like stochastic gradient descent but adapts\n",
    "  the learning rate for each parameter based on the variance of the gradient.\n",
    "  Weight decay encourages the parameters to be close to zero leading to more\n",
    "  stable input embeddings.\n",
    "- **Batching**. We suggest _no batching_ for this simple code. Thus, the\n",
    "  optimizer takes a step after each individual sentence. The `forward` method\n",
    "  should process only one input word at a time. Batching produces much faster\n",
    "  code and is recommended in practice, but it's not required here. If you want\n",
